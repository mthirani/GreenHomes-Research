# GreenHomes-Research
The research project has been kicked off by USF's Computer Science department where I had been part of the development team with the below said responsibilities. The main idea of the research is based on the energy savings of electrical components installed in homes. The prime focus till now is on below three electrical components installed in the residential house:

1. Refrigerator
2. Computer
3. Lighting

A Prototype Model to feed the user's gadget's information (basic information based on the sample questionnaire document) in the HTML page and get the approximate savings in terms of cost and electricity. This prototype model is build on HTML/ bootstrap with Javascript/ JQuery in client side to perform the computation and provide the savings. Server side scripting has been used via Node.js framework to host the applications and enabling the access to the MySQL database.
In order to run the prototype, you need to install Node.js framework and MySQL database server in your system. Also change the server port and MySQL database settings accordingly in HTTPServer.js script.
