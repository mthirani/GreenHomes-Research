	  <h5>We are conducting an academic survey about the types of tips that users would like to receive to help them save energy at home. We hope to use these results to built an intelligent system that helps users reduce energy consumption.
	  This survey will ask you to provide information about various appliances in your home, how you use those appliances, and your willingness to change your use of those appliances. Please answer as accurately as possible. 
	  This survey should take about 5 minutes to complete. Be assured that all answers you provide will be kept confidential and you may withdraw from the survey at any time.
	  At the end of the survey, you will receive a code to get credit for taking our survey.
	  </br></br>
	  Select the link below to complete the survey. Please don't repeat this survey if you have already completed it. We are not blocking repeat users in case this could cause issues with their accounts, but would appreciate if each turker only does the study once.  Thanks.

	  <strong>PLEASE MAKE NOTE OF THE CODE GENERATED AT THE END OF THE SURVEY TO GET THE CREDIT.</strong>
